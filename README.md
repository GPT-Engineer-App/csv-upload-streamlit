# csv-upload-streamlit

Develop a Streamlit application in Python consisting of two distinct pages for user navigation. On the initial page, users are prompted to upload a CSV file and input values into five designated fields. On the subsequent page, users will encounter a table displaying the entered values from the previous page. It's crucial to ensure that navigating between pages does not reset the input or uploaded file.
